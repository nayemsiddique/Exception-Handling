## Introduction

This project aims to provide a centralized approach for managing code exceptions in a .NET 6 application using middleware. By implementing custom middleware, you can intercept exceptions that occur during the request pipeline and handle them in a centralized manner. This approach promotes consistent error handling and provides a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
